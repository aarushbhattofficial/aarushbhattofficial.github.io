Academics
======
I am an undergraduate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.iitb.ac.in/) at IIT Bombay. \
The increasing gap between the advancements in Theoretical Physics and the Mathematical rigour troubles me. \
So, I thought I need proper mathematical training before tackling things on the intersection of the two.


Exposition
======
Sometimes, I also write long form scientific non-fiction focusing on fundamental physics. \
You can check out my work under Portfolio.

Resources
======
Currently, you can access my handwritten JEE Notes under Resources. \
I will make sure to upload my Math and Physics UG coursework notes as well as I move ahead in my academic journey.
