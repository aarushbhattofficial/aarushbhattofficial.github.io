A note of caution before proceeding. Like any other discipline, there is no strict demarcation of what comes under a certain field and what doesn’t. Some areas of study that I have mentioned separately may even be considered as just subfields of others at similar scales. Given the significant overlaps with engineering and other natural sciences, I have, whenever possible, taken arXiv as the reference for distinction.</p><p id="8abcd35e-018a-4999-bdb2-b299aaa888c2" class="">
</p><p id="ab01dcd5-0f9f-4a08-a34d-c40aac64684c" class="">Moreover, when I refer to the various ‘kinds of physics’ or dare I say ‘branches of physics’, I am referring to the things that the particular niche is focusing upon. This, in no way suggests or claims the fields being fundamentally different themselves or in their approach to studies. On the contrary, it should bring to one’s attention the wide assortment of interesting investigations that are being conducted under the same umbrella. Let us enjoy the fruit of efforts that the persual of curiosity by generations of physicists who came before us has led to.</p><p id="2d4765d7-2032-45f3-bb3a-da4bdf9dea70" class="">

And why do we need it ?<br/>Simply put, an order of magnitude refers to the exponent of 10 which lies nearest to a given value. For instance, 8 is closest to 10¹ and 8000 is closest to 10⁴. Hence the respective orders of magnitude of 8 and 8000 are 1 and 4. An estimation of such measure is by no means suitable for calculation purposes and fortunately, we don&#x27;t use orders of magnitude for it either. We can however, get a sense of the size (or the mass, length and duration) of the objects we are studying using this concept. <br/>But what help does this size distinction do ?<br/></p><p id="f1156eec-24fd-4a11-96af-4ec518e3027b" class="">

An axe, no matter how sharp, is unsuitable for cutting up the branches of the tree. Even if you do manage to use it for the same, the efforts put in could have been well utilised for some other task. Similarly, a knife will take an eternity to bring down and chop up a whole tree, unless you know what are doing. Analogous to the situation above, phenomenon at different scales may require applying the same principle (here, repeatedly striking with a sharp object), but the applications of these rules pertaining to a particular situation may not translate well enough to that of the other. So, given the different requirements for dealing with the &#x27;trunk&#x27; and the &#x27;branch&#x27;, we fine-tune our tools to minimize efforts and maximize efficiency. </p><p id="d2ab3971-62a5-48a2-a0f5-09f65e0b4293" class="">
</p><p id="cfad8557-88b2-423f-94c1-685f7dec760d" class="">In physics, this would mean using separate theories for separate orders of magnitude. That is to say, <strong>we</strong> <strong>deal with different scales differently.</strong><br/>This benefits us in a way that is specifically helpful for doing physics - it provides a way of to maintain a <br/><strong>separation of concerns. </strong>We can create theories at a certain scale and willingly neglect the contributions of smaller scale phenomenon, fullfilling the dual purpose of making sensible predictions and obtaining a bound on the possible errors produced due to the same, hence not compromising on the predictive power of the theory.</p><p id="69038c0d-9b75-4fb7-8ab7-ba34d65cfee3" class="">

</p><p id="e25f8c11-dd48-4147-ba18-4e13c5a463a1" class="">Physical cosmology as we know it today, is quite recent and began only after the development of Einstein’s theory of General Relativity in 1915. Later, research by Edwin Hubble and others revealed a whole new world of galaxies out there in space, moving away from us. This has led us to conclude that the universe must have existed in a state of high density and temperature. Big Bang is the theory we use to describe the expansion of universe from this inital state.</p><p id="11e73a27-4056-4ee8-a97f-e97252a1cb9a" class="">
</p><p id="6a4fbf44-bd3a-43d2-a964-04f1af230759" class="">We will not talk of the moments just after the Big Bang (till about 10-³² seconds) as it is expected that quantum effects of gravity dominate physical interactions at this scale and without any concrete theory of the same, there is not much scope of description. However, there seems to be considerable consensus on the happenings in the universe from about 10-³⁶ to 10-³² seconds after the Big Bang. This phase of the universe’s expansion is believed to be one where it went totally bezerk, expanding exponentially in a process known as inflation. There are different mechanisms by which inflationary models account for this phenomenon, which we will also not go into details of here. But the key takeaway is that inflationary theories solve 2 major problems in cosmology - the flatness problem and the horizon/homogeneity problem.</p><p id="7340657d-8e5f-494a-b587-74551a582c23" class="">
</p><p id="c508b739-b041-4e6b-bd2d-13f1c0cdc1bf" class="">The horizon/homogenetiy problem was first mentioned by Rindler in 1956. As per the Cosmic Mirowave Background (CMB), there exist large and distant regions of space between which, (assuming the standard Big Bang expansion) the light would not have had the time to travel yet have the same Microwave Background Temperature. Despite never being in the causal influence of each other, how can such far away regions be in thermal equilibrium. Similar to the horizon/homogeneity problem, we have the </p><p id="92d9b107-9ca3-473b-9436-18267f7c8992" class="">flatness problem. WMAP has determined the geometry of the universe to be nearly flat. However, under Big Bang cosmology, curvature grows with time and given the current status of our universe, it must have had a very specific amount of matter at the very specific moments of time to result in such a perfect geometry. These problem are what are called as <strong>cosmological fine-tuning</strong> problems.</p><p id="e24bfbec-2636-4db0-ba87-cce4b81c40ab" class="">

</p><p id="09a07543-6ba4-44c6-9b4d-5e95645fd2b8" class="">A decade of wait brought with it the first verifications of the quark model and finally a quantum theory of the strong force - Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) was fully formulated. This was followed by development of the Electroweak theory - a unified description of 2 of the 4 fundamental forces of nature, proposed by Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg. The Standard Model was being completed, albeit in bits and pieces, but nonetheless, each one was as essential to the framework as other. By 1990, only three of the fundamental particles remained to be found - the top quark, tau neutrino and Higgs boson. Fermilab found the top quark in April 1995 and the tau neutrino in July 2000. But the ‘God particle’ eluded us for yet another decade until CERN was able to get hold of it on 4 July 2012.</p><p id="4b9689aa-6033-4c84-899b-a79d5019dba8" class="">
</p><p id="2e496604-002a-4b92-bf8c-32671ea20984" class="">Till date, the Standard Model is the most successful theory in physics and remains the most rigorously tested as well, even more so than Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity which is currently untested in regions with strong gravitational influence.</p><p id="c7d972d7-8ee6-4b89-b63c-f47e48ee6309" class="">The theory describes all the fields and interactions known by us other than gravity and improves our understanding of the fundamental forces and particles of the universe. Still, there remain unanswered questions, primarily pertaining to the exclusion of gravity from such a ground breaking model of nature which has lead to speculations of physics <strong>Beyond the Standard Model</strong>. Searches for both conventional and unconventional resolutions to the lapses of the Standard Model continue to surprise us in new and interesting ways, giving us insight into the symmetries of fundamental particles, heavy flavor physics, matter-antimatter asymmetry, neutrino behaviour and dark matter and energy among other things.</p><p id="7a6313e0-e28b-4125-b5c4-8bd75961f5b0" class="">

I took me a long while to do so as well. But when I did, I realised something astonishing. We started off with Cosmology and came to know about its issue of quantum gravity. And you know what, this is exactly what the particle physicists are after as well ! </p><p id="1187cc45-9e60-48c6-ac77-a99d54ac2826" class="">
</p><p id="491bd5e0-67f6-4735-8c8b-ff1dbcbeb3ef" class="">With the exculsion of gravity from the Standard Model, a theory of quantum gravity is the biggest frontier for today’s physics. According to Brian Greene, the search for this ‘final theory’ or ‘master equation’ is the holy grail for physicists. We, having explored all these orders of magnitude, have completed a full circle !</p><p id="5daef10e-8f6d-4b19-bbd6-8dbb2cd4b9f6" class="">And this circle is the circle of reality and that of the pheonix of knowledge that obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessors. </p><p id="b90ea601-ddfb-4423-8b29-631d6ba63d44" class="">
